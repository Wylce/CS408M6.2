## Overview

This is a practice project focused on using CSS to style a letter-head template, with some
basic javascript included for a button and radio menu.

## Running

After cloning this repository into a local directory, this webpage can be run on a local 
server through VS Code's preview functionality. Note that in order to use the Preview
functionality, the Live Preview extension must be installed.

## Usage

Selecting a word from the "Select Word" radio menu and then clicking the "Submit Your
Word" button will create an alert popup with the word you selected. The radio menu can be 
navigated by mouse or by tabbing into the selection box and using arrow keys to pick an 
option.
